            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="InfoAboutME">
                I'm Ayush Bansal — a curious mind with a passion for building, exploring, and creating impact through
                technology. Whether it's crafting user-friendly websites, diving into new tech trends, or
                solving real-world problems, I thrive on learning and pushing my boundaries every day. <br><br><br>

                I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to grow both technically and creatively. With a strong
                foundation in: C, Java, Web3, front-end development, Full Stack development, SEO Optimization, etc..
                I've worked on several
                hands-on projects and actively participate in workshops, hackathons, and online communities to
                continuously level up. <br><br><br>

                When I'm not coding or exploring new ideas, you'll find me sharing knowledge, helping others, or
                reflecting deeply on how tech can make life easier, smarter, and more inclusive. <br><br><br>

                Let's connect — I'm always open to collaborations, ideas, or just a good conversation!</p>

        <p class="JourneyText">
            My journey into the world of technology began with an insatiable curiosity and a drive to build meaningful solutions. In my very first year of college, I actively sought opportunities to challenge myself — participating in three hackathons, where I had the privilege of winning one, a milestone that fueled my confidence and passion even further. <br><br><br>

            Beyond competitions, I remained committed to continuous learning. I successfully earned more than 18 certifications across various domains in technology — with a strong focus on web development, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and other emerging fields. These experiences not only broadened my technical expertise but also shaped my problem-solving mindset and adaptability. <br><br><br>

            Currently, I'm deeply engaged in enhancing my skills in front-end and back-end web development, building intuitive and responsive user experiences, and understanding how to secure digital systems in today's threat landscape. I enjoy working on projects that not only function well but are also built with performance, accessibility, and security in mind. <br><br><br>

            Looking ahead, my goal is to become a skilled and dependable full-stack developer, with a strong foundation in secure coding practices. I aspire to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with dynamic teams, and continually grow as a tech professional committed to real-world impact.
